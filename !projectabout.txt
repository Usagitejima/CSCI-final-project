Use of comments are important (For the interview. I'm counting on you on the commenting part :3)


Tips and tricks:

    - Read the whole PROJECT
    - For every struct and class you make, make a @brief description (type of comment)
    - For every function you write:
        - Write test cases
        - Write pseudocode
        - Write @brief @param and @return
        - Every variable function should have a comment
        - Every loops should have a comment
    - Make helper functions wherever you can for repetitive tasks
    - Start with bare minimum and slowly add features until the requirements are met
    - Start early and ask questions often


----------------------------------------WE HAVE TO DO SORTING ALGORITHM!!!!----------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------TIMELINES--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Friday, November 22th at 11:59 pm: Submit class files & Code Skeleton. The instructions for the skeleton are outlined below:
        – Describe the classes in your program, detailing all data members and member functions. Provide
complete class interfaces in header (.h) files as blueprints, including accessible functions but not
detailed implementations. Implement basic functions like getters and setters in source (.cpp) files.
Submit both the header (.h) and source (.cpp) files for each class.
– For complex class functions, define the function signature, return type, and the concept/objective
of each function (TIP: It might be helpful to use the function table format from the workbook).
We suggest you pseudocode each complex function (this will only help you!).
• Friday, December 6th at 11:59 pm: Interview Grading Sign-Up deadline. You must sign up for
an interview grading timeslot no later than Friday, December 6th at 11:59 pm. The interviews will
take place between December 12th and December 18th. If you do not sign up or miss your interview,
then no points will be awarded for the project.
– During the interview grading, TAs will be playing your game and asking questions about it. They
will also ask about your implementations and conceptual questions.

• Tuesday, December 11th at 11:59 pm: Final Deliverables. Your project will be due on Tuesday,
December 11th, at 11:59 pm. You must submit a zip file to the Project 2 assignment on Canvas,
including all .h and .cpp files. The submission should compile and run. TAs will also be grading
comments and code style.
• Monday or Tuesday, December 9th or 10th: Project presentation. You may present your
project during your recitation for extra credit.
• Saturday, December 14th at 11:59 pm: Project Report. Write a 1-2 page report containing the
following reflection questions:
– How did you prepare for the project?
– How did you develop our code skeleton? In what way(s) did you use your code skeleton?
– Reflect on how you could have done better or how you could have completed the project faster or
more eﬀiciently.
– In addition, write a paragraph answering the following question, in the context of the Project
in CSCI 1300: Did you have any false starts, or begin down a path only to have to turn back
when figuring out the strategy/algorithm for your Final Project program? Describe in detail what
happened, for example, what specific decision led you to the false starts, or, if not, why do you
think your work had progressed so smoothly. In either case, give a specific example.
– The report should be a 1-inch margin, single space, 12pt font size, Times New Roman. Submit a
report as PDF to Project2 Report on Canvas
